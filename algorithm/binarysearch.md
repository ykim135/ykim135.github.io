A divide and conquer search technique that halves the scope of search 
based on how small or large the search value is compared to a target value.
Binary search is performed on arrays and trees and it is essential to know 
how to implement the search using both structures.

Before we dive into code, I want to take a moment for a little storytelling to 
understand how the concept works. This is my most favorite method when it comes
to learning and teaching because it helps us understand the broad basics while abstracting
away the hard part which comes later.

I remember when I was serving in the military a couple of years ago back in 2014. I was 
a newly deployed private and my first mission was...

Organizing paperwork and handing over documents upon request.
